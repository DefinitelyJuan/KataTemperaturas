# Kata Temperaturas 
This repo consists of three session folders, each one filled with the respective code and test script done in the session. The program that should be coded on each session is the following: 

    TemperatureScale: Celsius Fahrenheit, Kelvin
      Temperature(5.48, TemperatureScale.Kelvin)
      Add(other : Temperature) : Temperature //Same scale as subject
      Substract(other : Temperature) : Temperature //Same scale as subject
      MultiplyBy(other : Temperature) : Temperature //Same scale as subject
      DivideBy(other : Temperature) : Temperature //Same scale as subject
      Scale : TemperatureScale
      ToFahrenheit() : Temperature
      ToCelsius() : ...
      ToKelvin() : ...
      ToString() : String // "5.4800F" 5.48C -5.48K

In other words, a class that has add, substract, multiply, divide, scale and fahrenheit, celcius and kelvin conversion methods. It will consist of two attributes: Value and scale (which can be Kelvin, Celcius or Fahrenheit
